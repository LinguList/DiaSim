LEXICON.README:

This file details how to properly construct a lexicon file so that it can be read by DiaSym.
 
The lexicon file should be a .tsv, so we speak of columns as being separated by tabs. 

THE ROWS:

Each row should represent the development over the different diachronic stages of an etymon, with each stage being indicated by a column and comments(see below) only placed if anywhere at the end of the last column.


COMMENTING : 

Any and all comments can only be placed in the final column and must be flagged with a "$". Typically they will be used to cite the phonological forms and etymology of a word. For example, from our demonstration simulation for Classical Latin goin to French: 
	
s 'ɑ ɡ m `ɑː r i u m	s ɔ m j e $sommier. Pope s674.

THE COLUMNS:

Each column represents a different diachronic stage. 
If a column is specified, it must be specified for all etyma/rows, without exception. 
In future versions of DiaSim, it will be possible to indicate that an etymon has either fallen out of usage or entered the vocabulary late by specifying "..." for stages where it is not present in the lexicon -- however, this feature is not supported by the current release of DiaSim. 

The first column, the only required one, must contain the initial forms for each etymon at the beginning of the diachronic simulation. 
Specifically, in the case of our French demonstration set, this is the Classical Latin form input. 
When and if other columns are specified, they will contain the phonological forms each etymon has at the stage that column corresponds to.
The forms entered in these columns will be the gold standard phonological forms that the forms obtained by the diachronic simulation at those respective stages will be compared to. 
In order for simulation results at any point to be compared to a gold set, that set must be associated with a stage in the rules file and a column in the lexicon file, with its gold forms for each etymon in the lexicon file. 
Without exception, each column specified must correspond to a diachronic stage that is declared in the rules file (see rules.README.txt-- a stage should be on a line declared immediately after the last rule that applied to its forms).
DiaSim will automatically associate stages in the rules file in the order they are declared to columns other than the input column, from left to right. 
If there is exactly one more column in use after all declared stages are associated to columns to its left, then the system will assume that this is the specification of the final output.
If there are still columns to the right of this final column, then DiaSim will throw an error. 
Likewise, if there are two few columns so that not every stage declared in the rules file is associated to a column, then DiaSim will also throw an error. 

Here is a sample row, showing the diachronic trajectory of Classical Latin sagmarium into French sommier, via Popular Latin, Old French, Later Old French, Middle French and Modern French.
