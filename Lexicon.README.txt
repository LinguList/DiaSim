LEXICON.README:

This file details how to properly construct a lexicon file so that it can be read by DiaSym.
 
The lexicon file should be a .csv, so we speak of columns as being separated by columns. 

COMMENTING : 

Any and all comments can only be placed in the final column and must be marked with a "$" flag before hand. Typically they will be used
	to cite the phonological forms and etymology of a word. For example, from our demonstration: 
	
s 'ɑ ɡ m `ɑː r i u m , s ɔ m j e $sommier. Pope 674.

THE FIRST LINE : 

The first line is very important, as it declares the names of "custom stages", at each of which the form of each etymon will be recorded
for future reference and statistic computation once the simulation ends. 


The first "column" must invariably be the input. Specifically, in the case of our French demonstration set, this is the Classical Latin
	form input. 
	
Whether one has other columns depends on... 

-- (a) if one will ultimately be comparing with a "gold" set for the end result of the simulation for each etymon. For our French 
	demonstration set, for example, this will be the modern French forms. 
-- (b) if one will be reporting the forms for any custom stages -- see below for explanation. 

"Custom stages" can be divided into two types: 

-- "Checkpoint" stages, for which a gold form is provided by the user in the lexicon file. 
-- "Milestone" stages, for which a gold form is not provided, but the forms the etyma have reached at that timestep will still be 
	saved to be reported with statistic at the end for association with final correct forms as well. Note that these statistics, described
	at length in the OUTPUTS.README file, will be reported also for checkpoint stages.
	
The marking of checkpoint stages and milestone stages in the first line, the stage declaration line, the two types are marked differently:

-- Checkpoint stages are preceded by a comma "," , making them a different column as the lexicon file is a .csv
-- Milestone stages are preceded by a pipe "|", meaning they effectively reside in the previous column of the .csv . As described in the
	next section, no gold for them will be described for the etyma. Thus, each non-initial column will have 

In the case of our French demonstration, we are making use of both. 

On the first line, the names of stages should be specified. However, the names of both the final result and the initial forms do not
	require specification. Instead, there presence should be marked by the delimitation between them and other stages using a comma or | 
	as appropriate, but the only need a space rather than a name. 

The one thing that is not optional is the initial input column, and this column must not have a name. If a name (non-blank space area) 
	is detected before the first pipe or comma, then the system will throw an error.

If there is a name (anything other than blank space) after the last comma or pipe, then this will imply to the system that there is no
	gold to compare the final results to. 

Thus, in the most complicated form, the first line should be as follows: 

 | Milestone 1 name , Checkpoint 1 name | Milestone 2 name | Milestone 3 name , Checkpoint 2 name , ...(et cetera)... , 

On the otherhand, in the most basic case, where one is not inputting any gold for either the final results or any checkpoint stages, 
	the first line will consist only of a space. If one is not using any checkpoint stages for only using milestone stages, there will
	only be a single column, so there is no use of any comma delimiter:
	
 | Milestone 1 name | Milestone 2 name | ... | Last milestone name

Finally, if the one will be comparing to a gold set only for the result, then one will simply have a space or a comma for the first line: 

 , 

THE REST (ETYMON LINES): 

Each line of the lexicon should represent a single etymon. 

The first column will invariably be the initial input's phonological form for that etymon. Thus, to use the example of sommier from above,
	in this case each etymon line will have the following form: 
	
s 'ɑ ɡ m `ɑː r i u m $sommier. Pope 674.

If one will not be comparing against a gold set for either the ultimate results or the generated results at any of the custom "checkpoint" 
	stages (see above), then this will be the only column. Otherwise, there will be a column for any gold that will be compared to.
	
Milestone stages, on the other hand, will not correspond to any notation for the etymon lines, as they do not involve comparing the
	system's results against a gold. 

If we are comparing to a gold only for the final result, etymon lines should have the following form, again using our case of sommier: 

s 'ɑ ɡ m `ɑː r i u m , s ɔ m j e $sommier. Pope 674.

If we have checkpoint stages, instead, it will have this form: 
s 'ɑ ɡ m `ɑː r i u m , s 'ɑ w m `ɑ r ʝ o , s 'o m `i ɛ̯ r , s 'ũ m j `e r , s 'ũ m j `e , s ɔ m j e $sommier. Pope 674.
