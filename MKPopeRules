$From Mildred Katherine Pope's 1934 "From Latin to Modern French"
$We follow exactly the order as stipulated in Chapter II starting on page 72, with some input from other chapters where appropriate
$However, she explains in her elaboration chapters some places where clearly the order is not what it is listed as in Chapter 4,
$ ... so we implement those instead

$Characteristics of Classical Latin as per Pope page 75
[+nas,+cor] > [+hi,+back,-cor] / __ [+hi,+back,-cont]
ɡ > [+nas] / __ n
l l > lʲ $REALLY unsure about this one... 
l > [+hi,+front] / __ [+hi,+front] $ Pope says this one is "probable" -- might make sense to remove
l > [+back] / @ __
[+lo,+syl] > [-front,+back]
ɑ > a / __ e̯

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii --- ns > s, with compensatory lengthening of prior vowel -- must have occurred before nature of length changed
$Pope says "very early" s359
$Of course later authors would very likely consider this to be part of a nasalization phenomenon.
[+syl] > [+long] / __ n s
n > ∅ / __ s

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii --- rs > s or ss, conditioned on whether preceeding vowel is long -- must have occurred before nature of length changed
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [+syl,+long] __ s
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [-cons] [-cons] __ s
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > s / [+syl,-long] __ s

$This one moved up simply because it is known to be characteristic of Classical Latin
$Page 72-73, section 154i ~ elaborated p 89 s 179 
$Classical Latin length distintion becomes a quality ("tense" for us) distinction
[+syl,-lo,-long] > [-tense]

$ TODO find the attribution for this ! 
[-tense] > [+tense] / __ [+syl] 

~Late Latin
$As per Pope's paradigm, it is considered Late Latin if it occurred before the end of the firth century 

$p73 s155i ~ p91 s185 -- Pope explains that this happened word-internally first "very early", word initially later 
h > ∅ / @ __

$p145 s361- i-epentheiss -- happens in Western Romance very early, attested second century
∅ > ɪ / # __ s [+cons] 

$p100 s214i -- the one case of stress movement, occurred in third and fourth centuries . 
$ Must come before yod formation as per s214i -- but this is a contradiction as yod formation was supposed to have happened earlier than that...
$ given that it bled w > beta, which happened in the first and second centuries? 
[+syl,-lo,-hi,-stres] > [+prim] / [+prim,-lo,+front,-long] __ 
[+prim] > [-stres] /  __ [+prim]

$p73 s155iib and p91 s187 -- we know develarization of w came very early, 1st/2nd century (Reign of "Nerβa") and that it was preceeded by 
$ the gliding phenomenon below

$p102 s220 (also p73 s156i)  -- yod and w formation -- gliding of unstressed short non-low vowels before other vowels
$ -- called upon to be this early by p91 s187
[+syl,-long,-stres,-lo] > [+hi,-syl] / __ [+syl]

$p91 s187iic -- explicitly must come after p102 s220 
$effacement of w before jod. 
$NOTE however that in many nouns this was reversed by analogy (see p92 s188)
w > ∅ / __ j

$p91 s187ii
w > ∅ / [+syl] __ [+syl,+round,+back]

$ p100 s214ii : in trisyllables with stress initially on the first, it moves forward ("ordinarily") 
$ if hte second consists of short vowel + plosive + r
[-stres] > [+prim] / # ([-syl])* [+prim] ([-syl])* __ [-cont] [+cor,+son,-nas,-lat]
[+prim,+stres] > [-prim] / # ([-syl])* __ ([-syl])* [+prim]

$ p115 s261-264 ~ s221 ~ s156i
$ *** Note as per s156i, for Pope this is a "tendency" 
$ the slurring ... of "proparoxytones" ... i.e. where the tonic syllable was followed by two unstressed sylls before hte word coda
$ ... typically concerning those which are common suffixes here.
$ Pope attests this with the Appendix Probi, which was written in the third or fourth centuries 
$ but does not say that is when it specifically occurred. 
$ Because of words like "table", we know it probably occurred before lenition of intervocalic b (early second century) but Pope does not confirm
$ this either. 
$ By placing it here before the beginning of betacism, we are giving Pope the benefit of the doubt. 
$ This is also inline with what she states about the -itus,-itum etc group -- she is holding that this phenomenon occurred before hte beginnings
$ 	of palatalization for words like plakitum (s296)
$ Further note : s262b -- Pope notes that sometimes the older forms were restored by preservative analogy via "clerkly influence" 
$ p115 s262a -- effects on -ulus,-ulum,-ula words. Attested for affecting those where preceding cons is k,g,t,p or b. There don't seem to be
	$ any words of this type ending in -dulus,-dulum, or -dula. 
ʊ > ∅ / [+prim] ([-syl])* [-cont,-syl] __ [+lat] [+syl] ([-syl]) #
$ p115 s262b -- effects on the -idus,-idis,-itis etc group : for prior consonsants Pope lists l, g, t, s, k, and r
	$ the most faithful way to render this also in line with Occam's Razor would seem to be [+cons] 
	$ *** NOTE s353 -- seems to imply it was possible for this to NOT occur for some words
	$ note also the frigidus contradiction: s297 & s316 vs. s262ii & s296i
ɪ > ∅ / [+prim] ([-syl])* [+cons] __ [+cor,-son,-cont] [+syl] ([-syl]) #
$ p115 s262c -- effects on intertonic vowels standing between n/l and r 
[-lo,-stres,+syl] > ∅ / [+prim] ([-syl])* n __ [+cor,+son,-lat]
[-lo,-stres,+syl] > ∅ / [+prim] ([-syl])* [+lat,-syl] __ [+cor,+son,-lat]

$p91 s186: w>beta. Occurred during the 1st and 2nd century ("Nerβa")
w > β

$as per p91 s187i -- reverse when became preconsonantal due to "slurring" 


$p73 s155iia and pp136-137 ss332-336 and p6 s9 : b > β intervocalically or between vowel and r
$According to s336 this occurred very early at least for the bilabial, 2nd century AD 
$Later authors group all voiced stops together for this shift, but Pope is unclear
$She states (s336) that it is attested earlier for b than the others but is unclear
$However she indicates a shift order in s307i that necessitates velar stop palatalization preceding intervocalic lenition
$So we give her the benefit of the doubt and place the lenition of the rest of the velar stops later,
$Right after the beginning of palatalization. 
b > β / [+syl] __ [+son,-lat,-nas]

$ p115 s263 -- with proparoxytons with intervocalic g, both g and preceding vowel deleted
	$ given the hypothesized forms listed by Pope, it is clear she thinks this happened before  ɪ > e and ʊ > o 
[+syl,-stres] [+hi,+voi,-syl] > ∅ / [+prim] ([-syl])* [-syl] __ [+syl] ([-syl])* #

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii : simplification in ŋks, ŋkt clusters
k > ∅

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii : kst > st rule 
k > ∅ / __ s [+cons]

$p144 s359 ~ p134 s324-325 ~ p73 s156iii ~ p64 s130 ~ p6 s9
$ frication of k before t,s ; attributed to Gaulish substratum p6 s9 (RECTUM > REXTUM -- see also discussion of attestations like paraxsidi in other sources.) 
$ Pope doesn't discuss the specific ordering of this vis-a-vis the kst>st rule, but this one would bleed that one and she never discusses an xst>st rule,
$ so we assume this one comes second.
k > x / __ [+cor,-voi] 

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii : g > w before m, Pope says this is first attested in teh 3rd/4th century Appendix Prodi 
$"opened and vocalized"-- Pope is explicit that it passes through a fricatie stage p65 s135b
ɡ > [+cont] / __ m 
ɣ > w / __ m 

$p73 s154i ~ elaborated p89 s180 : ɪ > e and ʊ > o 
[+hi,-tense] > [-hi,+tense] 

$p73 s154iii ~ p190 s504 -- seems to have first occurred in the first and second centuries s504
$giving her the benefit of hte doubt, we place this after the length > tense shift, as otherwise oe would become ɛ
$ 	given that she doesn't specify it as long and writes it like a short vowel 
{a e̯;'a e̯;`a e̯} > {ɛː;'ɛː;`ɛː}
{o e̯;'o e̯;`o e̯} > {eː;'eː;`eː}

$Page 72-73, section 154i ~ elaborated p 89 s 179 , s222
$Classical Latin length disctintion becomes a quality ("tense" for us) distinction

$p73 s156vi ~ p191 s505 ~ p64 s131: au > a under influence of tonic u in next syllable (irregardless of tense or length)
$ ... NOTE: Pope is not clear about when exactly this occurred, but we place it before ʊ > o for convenience
ɑ [-syl,-cons,-lo,+round,+back] > ɑ / __ ([-syl])* [+prim,+hi,+round,+back]

$p328 s854 ~ p64 s131 : dissimilation of tonic vowel juxtaposed to final flexional vowel. 
$ *** this is a "tendency" as per Pope s854
$ Other authors have other explanations for this, like tensing of vowels before other vowels or even much earlier lengthening of them

$ p73 s156v ~ s262 ~ s360

t > k / __ [+lat]

$ p97-98 s205i ~ p73 s156ii : final m deletion  -- 
$ ... unlike some later authors Pope does not recognize a nasalization in Late Latin, instead holding that simple nasal consonant deletion occurred
$ Pope doesn't explicitly date this but considers it first attested in teh 3rd/4th century Appendix Probi
$ Pope notes it did not occur in monosyllabic words 
$ NOTE: as per p97-98 s205i -- unlike Italy and also South Gaul, North Gaul did not see effacement of s and t word-finally,
$ ... because "prnounciation was influenced by the teaching in schools" in North Gaul
m > ∅ / [+syl] ([-syl])* [+syl] __ #

$ p185 s488 : o > ɔ before labial consonants 
$ *** NOTE : This is called a "TENDENCY" by Pope
$ she does not give a date to it other than saying it Late Latin
$ --- we give her the benefit and place it after final m deletion 
o > ɔ / __ [+lab,-son] 

$Palatalization begins in the fourth century as per Pope p129 s304

$p73 s155iia and pp136-137 ss332-336 and p6 s9 : intervocalic lenition between vowel and (vowel or r)
$According to s336 this occurred very early at least for the bilabial, 2nd century AD 
$Later authors group all voiced stops together for this shift, but Pope is unclear
$She states (s336) that it is attested earlier for b than the others but is unclear
$However she indicates a shift order in s307i that necessitates velar stop palatalization preceding intervocalic lenition
$So we give her the benefit of the doubt and place the lenition of the rest of the velar stops later,
$Right after the beginning of palatalization. This should be roughly 4th century
$ inclusion of palatal voiced stop in this shift -- as per Pope p127 s297
[-cont,-delrel,+voi] > [+cont] / [+syl] __ [+son,-lat,-nas]

$p73 s155i ~ p91 s185 -- as Pope explained, happened word-internally first. 
$It was apparently still being resisted among the educated classes in the time of St. Augustine, 4th century and early 5th century 
h > ∅ 

$p73 s156vi -- influence of tonic vowels on countertonic vowels

# followed by cons + vowel, or followed by plosive + l/r
