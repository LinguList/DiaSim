$We follow exactly the order as stipulated in Chapter II starting on page 72, with some input from other chapters where appropriate

$Characteristics of Classical Latin as per Pope page 75
[+nas,+cor] > [+hi,+back,-cor,-ant] / __ [+hi,+back,-cont]
ɡ > [+nas,+cont] / __ [+nas,+cor]
l l > lʲ $REALLY unsure about this one... 
l > [+hi,+front] / __ [+hi,+front] $ Pope says this one is "probable" -- might make sense to remove
l > [+back] / @ __
[+lo,+syl] > [-front,+back]
[+lo,+syl] > [+front,-back] / __ e̯
{j;w} > [+cons,-son] / __ [+syl] $as per Pope s106 -- Pope considers w and j when not "vocalic" (i.e. part of diphthong) to be fricative
	$ for j, p55 s105c ; for w, p56 s109
$ Note that the sequence u: + w does not seem to occur in Latin 
$ If it did there would be some logical issues with Pope's rules -- i.e. s343 she states "beta from b" is effaced after u: 
	$ where of course w (by which she means gamma^w) had already shifted to beta s186 much earlier 
	$ -- of course sound change has no memory! However this issue is moot because u:+w doesn't occur in Latin it seems

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii --- ns > s, with compensatory lengthening of prior vowel -- must have occurred before nature of length changed
$Pope says "very early" s359
$Of course later authors would very likely consider this to be part of a nasalization phenomenon.
[+syl] > [+long] / __ n s
n̪ > ∅ / __ s

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii --- rs > s or ss, conditioned on whether preceeding vowel is long -- must have occurred before nature of length changed

[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [-cons] [-cons] __ s
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > s / [+syl,-long] __ s

$This one moved up simply because it is known to be characteristic of Classical Latin

$Classical Latin length distinction becomes a quality ("tense" for us) distinction
[+syl,-lo,-long] > [-tense]

~Late Latin
$As per Pope's paradigm, it is considered Late Latin if it occurred before the end of the firth century 

$p73 s155i ~ p91 s185 -- Pope explains that this happened word-internally first "very early", word initially later 
h > ∅ / @ __

$p145 s361- i-epenthesis -- happens in Western Romance very early, attested second century
∅ > ɪ / # __ s [+cons] 

$p100 s214i -- one case of regular stress movement, occurred in third and fourth centuries . 
$ Must come before yod formation as per s214i -- but this is a contradiction as yod formation was supposed to have happened earlier than that...
$ given that it bled w > beta, which happened in the first and second centuries? 
[+syl,-lo,-hi,-stres] > [+prim] / [+prim,-lo,+front,-long] __ 
[+prim] > [-prim] / # ([-syl])* __ [+prim]
[+prim] > [-stres] /  __ [+prim]

$p100 s214ii -- the (only?) other case of regular stress movement-- occurred around the same time but not for the educated classes
[+syl,-stres] > [+prim] / [+prim] ([-syl])* __ [-cont] r ([-syl])* [+syl] ([-syl])* #
[+prim] > [-prim] / # ([-syl])* __ ([-syl])* [+prim]
[+prim] > [-stres] / __ ([-syl])* [+prim]

$p73 s155iib and p91 s187 -- we know develarization of w came very early, 1st/2nd century (Reign of "Nerβa") and that it was preceeded by 
$ the gliding phenomenon below

$p102 s220 (also p73 s156i)  -- yod and w formation -- gliding of unstressed short non-low vowels before other vowels
$ -- called upon to be this early by p91 s187
[+syl,-long,-stres,-lo] > [+hi,-syl,+tense] / __ [+syl]

{w;j} > [+cons,-son] / __ [+syl] $as per Pope s106 -- Pope considers w and j when not "vocalic" (i.e. part of diphthong) to be fricative
	$ for j, p55 s105c ; for w, p56 s109

$p91 s187iic -- explicitly must come after p102 s220 
$effacement of w before jod. 
$NOTE however that in many nouns this was reversed by analogy (see p92 s188)
ɣʷ > ∅ / __ ʝ

$p91 s187iia
ɣʷ > ∅ / [+syl] __ [+syl,+round,+back]

$ p100 s214ii : in trisyllables with stress initially on the first, it moves forward ("ordinarily") 
$ if hte second consists of short vowel + plosive + r
[-stres] > [+prim] / # ([-syl])* [+prim] ([-syl])* __ [-cont] [+cor,+son,-nas,-lat]
[+prim,+stres] > [-prim] / # ([-syl])* __ ([-syl])* [+prim]

$ p115 s261-264 ~ s221 ~ s156i
$ *** Note as per s156i, for Pope this is a "tendency" 
$ the slurring ... of "proparoxytones" ... i.e. where the tonic syllable was followed by two unstressed sylls before hte word coda
$ ... typically concerning those which are common suffixes here.
$ Pope attests this with the Appendix Probi, which was written in the third or fourth centuries 
$ but does not say that is when it specifically occurred. 
$ Because of words like "table", we know it probably occurred before lenition of intervocalic b (early second century) but Pope does not confirm
$ this either. 
$ By placing it here before the beginning of betacism, we are giving Pope the benefit of the doubt. 
$ This is also inline with what she states about the -itus,-itum etc group -- she is holding that this phenomenon occurred before hte beginnings
$ 	of palatalization for words like plakitum (s296)
$ Further note : s262b -- Pope notes that sometimes the older forms were restored by preservative analogy via "clerkly influence" 
$ p115 s262a -- effects on -ulus,-ulum,-ula words. Attested for affecting those where preceding cons is k,g,t,p or b. There don't seem to be
	$ any words of this type ending in -dulus,-dulum, or -dula. 
ʊ > ∅ / [+prim] ([-syl])* [-cont] __ [+lat] [+syl] ([-syl]) #
$ p115 s262b -- effects on the -idus,-idis,-itis etc group : for prior consonsants Pope lists l, g, t, s, k, and r
	$ the most faithful way to render this also in line with Occam's Razor would seem to be [+cons] 
	$ *** NOTE s353 -- seems to imply it was possible for this to NOT occur for some words
	$ note also the frigidus contradiction: s297 & s316 vs. s262ii & s296i
ɪ > ∅ / [+prim] ([-syl])* [+cons] __ [+cor,-son,-cont] [+syl] ([-syl]) #

[-lo,-stres,+syl] > ∅ / [+prim] ([-syl])* n __ [+cor,+son,-lat]
[-lo,-stres,+syl] > ∅ / [+prim] ([-syl])* [+lat,-syl] __ [+cor,+son,-lat]

$as per p91 s187i -- ɣʷ > w when preconsonantal due to "slurring" 
ɣʷ > w / __ [+cons]

$ as per s186, ɣʷ retained after k -- for sanity's sake we shift it back to w here so that it doens't go to beta
ɣʷ > w / k __ 

$ as per s186iib -- w effaced between k and a rounded vowel
	$ Note most authors interpret this differently, as the delabialization of k
w > ∅ / k __ [+syl,+round] 

$p91 s186: w>beta. Occurred during the 1st and 2nd century ("Nerβa")
ɣʷ > β

$p73 s155iia and pp136-137 ss332-336 and p6 s9 : b > β intervocalically or between vowel and r (s372)
$According to s336 this occurred very early at least for the bilabial, 2nd century AD 
$Later authors group all voiced stops together for this shift, but Pope is unclear
$She states (s336) that it is attested earlier for b than the others but is unclear
$However she indicates a shift order in s307i that necessitates velar stop palatalization preceding intervocalic lenition
$So we give her the benefit of the doubt and place the lenition of the rest of the velar stops later,
$Right after the beginning of palatalization. 
b > β / [+syl] __ [+son,-lat,-nas]

$In the second century, all aspiration on Greek loanwords was lost.

$ Pope notes it did not occur in monosyllabic words
