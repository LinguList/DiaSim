$From Mildred Katherine Pope's 1934 "From Latin to Modern French"
$We follow exactly the order as stipulated in Chapter II starting on page 72, with some input from other chapters where appropriate
$However, she explains in her elaboration chapters some places where clearly the order is not what it is listed as in Chapter 4,
$ ... so we implement those instead
$ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

~Late Latin
$First rule for Pope is the "accent change" -- not sure how to realize this -- it is section 153 on page 72 and elaborated on on pages 99-102 

$Characteristics of Classical Latin as per Pope page 75
[+nas,+cor] > [+hi,+back,-cor] / __ [+hi,+back,-cont]
[-cont,+hi,+back,+voi] > [+nas] / __ [+nas]
l l > lʲ $REALLY unsure about this one... 
l > [+hi,+front] / __ [+hi,+front]
l > [+back] / @ __

$This one moved up simply because it is known to be characteristic of Classical Latin
$Page 72-73, section 154i ~ elaborated p 89 s 179 
$Classical Latin length disctintion becomes a quality ("tense" for us) distinction
[+syl,-lo,-long] > [-tense]

$p73 s155i ~ p91 s185 -- Pope explains that this happened word-internally first "very early", word initially later 
h > ∅ / @ __

$p73 s155iib and p91 s187 -- we know develarization of w came very early (Reign of "Nerβa") and that it was preceeded by 
$ the gliding phenomenon

$p102 s220 (also p73 s156i)  -- gliding of unstressed short non-low vowels before other vowels
$ -- called upon to be this early by p91 s187
[+syl,-long,-stres,-lo] > [+hi,-syl] / __ [+syl]

$p91 s187iic -- explicitly must come after p102 s220 
$effacement of w before jod. 
$NOTE however that in many nouns this was reversed by analogy (see p92 s188)
w > ∅ / __ j

$p91 s187ii
w > ∅ / [+syl] __ [+syl,+round,+back]

$ the slurring ... of "proparoxytones" ... 

$p91 s186: w>beta. Occurred during the 1st and 2nd century ("Nerβa")
w > β

$as per p91 s187i -- reverse when became preconsonantal due to "slurring" 

$p73 s155iia and pp136-137 ss332-336 : b > β intervocalically or between vowel and r
$According to s336 this occurred very early, 2nd century AD 
b > β / [+syl] __ [+son,-lat,-nas]

$Page 72-73, section 154i ~ elaborated p 89 s 179 
$Classical Latin length disctintion becomes a quality ("tense" for us) distinction
[+syl,-lo,-long] > [-tense]
[+syl,-lo,+long] > [-long,+tense]
[+syl,+long] > [-long]

$p73 s155i ~ p91 s185 -- as Pope explained, happened word-internally first. 
$It was apparently still being resisted among the educated classes in the time of St. Augustine, 4th century and early 5th century 
h > ∅ 

$p73 s154i ~ elaborated p89 s180
$ɪ > e and ʊ > o 
[+hi,-tense] > [-hi,+tense] 

$p73 s154iii ~ p190 s504
{a e̯;'a e̯;`a e̯} > {ɛ;'ɛ;`ɛ}
{o e̯;'o e̯;`o e̯} > {e;'e;`e}

$ stress changes... 

$p73 s154ii : length returns for stressed vowels only, conditioned the open/closed context condition




$p73 s154ii ~ elaborated somewhat in the chapter covering prosody
