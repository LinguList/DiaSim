$We follow exactly the order as stipulated in Chapter II starting on page 72, with some input from other chapters where appropriate
$However, she explains in her elaboration chapters some places where clearly the order is not what it is listed as in Chapter 4,

[+lo,+syl] > [-front,+back]
[+lo,+syl] > [+front,-back] / __ e̯
{j;w} > [+cons,-son] / __ [+syl] $as per Pope s106 -- Pope considers w and j when not "vocalic" (i.e. part of diphthong) to be fricative
	$ for j, p55 s105c ; for w, p56 s109
$ Note that the sequence u: + w does not seem to occur in Latin 
$ If it did there would be some logical issues with Pope's rules -- i.e. s343 she states "beta from b" is effaced after u: 
	$ where of course w (by which she means gamma^w) had already shifted to beta s186 much earlier 
	$ -- of course sound change has no memory! However this issue is moot because u:+w doesn't occur in Latin it seems

$In the second century, all aspiration on Greek loanwords was lost.

~Late Latin
$As per Pope's paradigm, it is considered Late Latin if it occurred before the end of the firth century 

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii --- ns > s, with compensatory lengthening of prior vowel -- must have occurred before nature of length changed
$Pope says "very early" s359
$Of course later authors would very likely consider this to be part of a nasalization phenomenon.
[+syl] > [+long] / __ n̪ s
n̪ > ∅ / __ s

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii --- rs > s or ss, conditioned on whether preceeding vowel is long -- must have occurred before nature of length changed
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [+syl,+long] __ s
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [-cons] [-cons] __ s
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > s / [+syl,-long] __ s

$This one moved up simply because it is known to be characteristic of Classical Latin

w > ∅ / k __ [+syl,+round] 

$ p115 s261-264 ~ s221 ~ s156i
$ *** Note as per s156i, for Pope this is a "tendency" 
$ the slurring ... of "proparoxytones" ... i.e. where the tonic syllable was followed by two unstressed sylls before hte word coda
$ ... typically concerning those which are common suffixes here.
$ Pope attests this with the Appendix Probi, which was written in the third or fourth centuries but does not say that is when it specifically occurred. 
$ Because of words like "table", we know it probably occurred before lenition of intervocalic b (early second century) but Pope does not confirm this either. 
$ By placing it here before the beginning of betacism, we are giving Pope the benefit of the doubt. 
$ This is also inline with what she states about the -itus,-itum etc group -- she is holding that this phenomenon occurred before hte beginnings
$ 	of palatalization  (s296)
$ Further note : s262b -- Pope notes that sometimes the older forms were restored by preservative analogy via "clerkly influence" 
$ p115 s262a -- effects on -ulus,-ulum,-ula words. Attested for affecting those where preceding cons is k,g,t,p or b. There don't seem to be
	$ any words of this type ending in -dulus,-dulum, or -dula.

$ p115 s262b -- effects on the -idus,-idis,-itis etc group : for prior consonsants Pope lists l, g, t, s, k, and r
	$ the most faithful way to render this also in line with Occam's Razor would seem to be [+cons]

$p73 s155iia and pp136-137 ss332-336 and p6 s9 : b > β intervocalically or between vowel and r (s372)
$According to s336 this occurred very early at least for the bilabial, 2nd century AD 
$Later authors group all voiced stops together for this shift, but Pope is unclear
$She states (s336) that it is attested earlier for b than the others but is unclear
$However she indicates a shift order in s307i that necessitates velar stop palatalization preceding intervocalic lenition
$So we give her the benefit of the doubt and place the lenition of the rest of the velar stops later,
$Right after the beginning of palatalization.
$ she is not clear about whether her j and w ("fricatives") are sonorant, but we will assume they are NOT
