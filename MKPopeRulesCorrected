$From Mildred Katherine Pope's 1934 "From Latin to Modern French"
$We follow exactly the order as stipulated in Chapter II starting on page 72, with some input from other chapters where appropriate
$However, she explains in her elaboration chapters some places where clearly the order is not what it is listed as in Chapter 4,
$ ... so we implement those instead

$Characteristics of Classical Latin as per Pope page 75
n̪ > ŋ / __ [+hi,+back,-cont]
ɡ > ŋ / __ [+nas,+cor]

$ CORRECTION : ɸ > f 
ɸ > f 

$ CORRECTION: We delete Pope's handling of Classical Latin's variant l-allophones, as they do not seem to be diachronically relevant, and harm performance.

[+lo,+syl] > [-front,+back]
[+lo,+syl] > [+front,-back] / __ e̯
{j;w} > [+cons,-son] / __ [+syl] $as per Pope s106 -- Pope considers w and j when not "vocalic" (i.e. part of diphthong) to be fricative
	$ for j, p55 s105c ; for w, p56 s109
$ Note that the sequence u: + w does not seem to occur in Latin 
$ If it did there would be some logical issues with Popeˌs rules -- i.e. s343 she states "beta from b" is effaced after u: 
	$ where of course w (by which she means gamma^w) had already shifted to beta s186 much earlier 
	$ -- of course sound change has no memory! However this issue is moot because u:+w doesnˌt occur in Latin it seems
	
$ CORRECTION : Pope forgets to mention that w is a proper w not ɣʷ after velar consonants hence why we don't end up with tons of kv clusters.
$ To be sure she does note (s186) that "betacism doesn't occur after k" but she doesn't notice that other affects she attriutes to ɣʷ are not occuring in the presence
$ of k -- such as the deletion of the rounded "fricative"/approximant before ʝ (indeed after kw, it is the ʝ that is deleted it seems...) 
ɣʷ > w / [+back,+hi,+cons] __

$In the second century, all aspiration on Greek loanwords was lost.

$Pope p226-7 s632
$ Greek y unrounded to i 
[+hi,+front] > [-round,-lab]

$~Late Latin
$As per Popeˌs paradigm, it is considered Late Latin if it occurred before the end of the firth century 

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii --- ns > s, with compensatory lengthening of prior vowel -- must have occurred before nature of length changed
$Pope says "very early" s359
$CORRECTION: now lengthening occurs in the context of non-stressed following syllable, and the n loss is triggered by being between a specifically long vowel and s.
[+syl] > [+long] / __ n̪ s ([-syl])* [+syl,-stres] 
n̪ > ∅ / [+syl,+long] __  s

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii -- per Pope, rs > s or ss, conditioned on whether preceding vowel is long -- must have occurred before nature of length changed
$ CORRECTION : we only implement the one occurring after long vowels and two vowel sequences,
$ Because the rs > ss shift after single short vowels seems to only be correct for two lexemes, persica and dorsum.
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [+syl,+long] __ s
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [-cons] [-cons] __ s
$ [+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > s / [+syl,-long] __ s -- CORRECTION deleting this. 

$ CORRECTION: long e: before j becomes short
ˈeː > ˈe / __ j

$ CORRECTION: stressed i +  e > iː j (case of pietatem)
$ CORRECTION: but this doesn't occur before nasals 
[+hi,+front,+stres] e > [+long] j / __ [-nas]

$This one moved up simply because it is known to be characteristic of Classical Latin

$p73 s155iib and p91 s187 -- we know develarization of w came very early, 1st/2nd century (Reign of "Nerβa") and that it was preceded by 
$ the gliding phenomenon below

$ CORRECTION : rare case of immediate and very early stopping of ɛ in -ɛʊm -- cases of extraneum, hordeum and cereum

$ as per s186iib -- w effaced between k and a rounded vowel
	$ Note most authors interpret this differently, as the delabialization of k

$ p115 s261-264 ~ s221 ~ s156i
$ *** Note as per s156i, for Pope this is a "tendency" 
$ the slurring ... of "proparoxytones" ... i.e. where the tonic syllable was followed by two unstressed sylls before hte word coda
$ ... typically concerning those which are common suffixes here.
$ Pope attests this with the Appendix Probi, which was written in the third or fourth centuries but does not say that is when it specifically occurred. 
$ Because of words like "table", we know it probably occurred before lenition of intervocalic b (early second century) but Pope does not confirm this either. 
$ By placing it here before the beginning of betacism, we are giving Pope the benefit of the doubt. 
$ This is also inline with what she states about the -itus,-itum etc group -- she is holding that this phenomenon occurred before hte beginnings
$ 	of palatalization  (s296)
$ Further note : s262b -- Pope notes that sometimes the older forms were restored by preservative analogy via "clerkly influence" 
$ p115 s262a -- effects on -ulus,-ulum,-ula words. Attested for affecting those where preceding cons is k,g,t,p or b. There donˌt seem to be
	$ any words of this type ending in -dulus,-dulum, or -dula. 
$ CORRECTION : -mulum endings also effected (cumulum > comble; tremulum > tremble) 
$ CORRECTION : -rula endings also effected (berula (Gaul.) > berle not bierle) 
$ CORRECTION: -olum,-olus endings also included if not after a labial cons

$ CORRECTION : slur short i between ɣʷ and k 
$ Pope sort of implies this has occurred in s187i but doesn't state it elsewhere
ɪ > ∅ / ɣʷ __ k

$as per p91 s187i -- ɣʷ > w when preconsonantal due to "slurring"  $Note this has no effect as per Pope, even though she talks about slurring here, no slurring from a ɣʷ is anywhere close to be effectivev yet...
ɣʷ > w / __ [+cons]

$ CORRECTION: a much more effective and thorough way to describe the apparent contexts of deconsonantalization of ɣʷ here...
$ actually covering two shifts
$ it appears that this occurred in all ɑɣʷɪ sequences : navicellam, navicam, avicam, avicellam, Pictavis, etc...
$ Pope (s187i) says this is due to "slurring" but she nowhere else described the "slurring" phenomenon that would have fed the rule in this way
$ Doesn't happen when the posterior ɪ is stressed it seems -- see kˌɑwˈɪkulɑm > ʃəvij
$ Hence this is the most efficient way to represent it...: 
ɣʷ > w / [+lo,+syl] __ ɪ 
$ next, to cover the ɑɣʷɑ sequences (most of these being from Gaulish): bauam, flavam, cavannum. 
$Doesn't seem to happen for -aːre verbs (lava:re) -- this can be represented by only allowing the posterior ɑ to be short
ɣʷ > w / [+lo,+syl] __ [+lo,+syl,-long]

$p91 s186: w>beta. Occurred during the 1st and 2nd century ("Nerβa")
$ CORRECTION : as evidenced by Pope s343 causing errors for 10 words that became β from ɣʷ, we infer that they did not merge this early, and must have merged
$ AFTER that -- instead we send ɣʷ to βʷ 
ɣʷ > βʷ

$p73 s155iia and pp136-137 ss332-336 and p6 s9 : b > β intervocalically or between vowel and r (s372)
$According to s336 this occurred very early at least for the bilabial, 2nd century AD 
$Later authors group all voiced stops together for this shift, but Pope is unclear
$She states (s336) that it is attested earlier for b than the others but is unclear
$However she indicates a shift order in s307i that necessitates velar stop palatalization preceding intervocalic lenition
$So we give her the benefit of the doubt and place the lenition of the rest of the velar stops later,
$Right after the beginning of palatalization.
$ she is not clear about whether her j and w ("fricatives") are sonorant, but we will assume they are NOT
	$... given that she called them fricatives -- this is supported by her trajectory for rubeum > rouge (s676)
b > β / [+syl] __ [+son,-lat,-nas]

$ p115 s263 -- with proparoxytons with intervocalic g, both g and preceding vowel deleted "early" (s263)

$ NOTE: as per p97-98 s205i -- unlike Italy and also South Gaul, North Gaul did not see effacement of s and t word-finally,
