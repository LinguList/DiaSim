$We follow exactly the order as stipulated in Chapter II starting on page 72, with some input from other chapters where appropriate

$Characteristics of Classical Latin as per Pope page 75
n̪ > ŋ / __ [+hi,+back,-cont]
ɡ > ŋ / __ [+nas,+cor]

$ CORRECTION: We delete Pope's handling of Classical Latin's variant l-allophones, as they do not seem to be diachronically relevant, and harm performance.

[+lo,+syl] > [-front,+back]
[+lo,+syl] > [+front,-back] / __ e̯
{j;w} > [+cons,-son] / __ [+syl] $as per Pope s106 -- Pope considers w and j when not "vocalic" (i.e. part of diphthong) to be fricative
	$ for j, p55 s105c ; for w, p56 s109
$ Note that the sequence u: + w does not seem to occur in Latin 
$ If it did there would be some logical issues with Popeˌs rules -- i.e. s343 she states "beta from b" is effaced after u: 
	$ where of course w (by which she means gamma^w) had already shifted to beta s186 much earlier 
	$ -- of course sound change has no memory! However this issue is moot because u:+w doesnˌt occur in Latin it seems
	
$ CORRECTION : Pope forgets to mention that w is a proper w not ɣʷ after velar consonants hence why we don't end up with tons of kv clusters.
$ To be sure she does note (s186) that "betacism doesn't occur after k" but she doesn't notice that other affects she attriutes to ɣʷ are not occuring in the presence
$ of k -- such as the deletion of the rounded "fricative"/approximant before ʝ (indeed after kw, it is the ʝ that is deleted it seems...) 
ɣʷ > w / [+back,+hi,+cons] __

$~Late Latin
$As per Popeˌs paradigm, it is considered Late Latin if it occurred before the end of the firth century 

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii --- ns > s, with compensatory lengthening of prior vowel -- must have occurred before nature of length changed
$Pope says "very early" s359
$CORRECTION: now lengthening occurs in the context of non-stressed following syllable, and the n loss is triggered by being between a specifically long vowel and s.
[+syl] > [+long] / __ n̪ s ([-syl])* [+syl,-stres] 
n̪ > ∅ / [+syl,+long] __  s

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii -- per Pope, rs > s or ss, conditioned on whether preceding vowel is long -- must have occurred before nature of length changed
$ CORRECTION : we only implement the one occurring after long vowels and two vowel sequences,
$ Because the rs > ss shift after single short vowels seems to only be correct for two lexemes, persica and dorsum.
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [+syl,+long] __ s
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [-cons] [-cons] __ s
$ [+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > s / [+syl,-long] __ s -- CORRECTION deleting this.

$ the slurring ... of "proparoxytones" ... i.e. where the tonic syllable was followed by two unstressed sylls before hte word coda
$ ... typically concerning those which are common suffixes here.
$ Pope attests this with the Appendix Probi, which was written in the third or fourth centuries but does not say that is when it specifically occurred. 
$ Because of words like "table", we know it probably occurred before lenition of intervocalic b (early second century) but Pope does not confirm this either. 
$ By placing it here before the beginning of betacism, we are giving Pope the benefit of the doubt. 
$ This is also inline with what she states about the -itus,-itum etc group -- she is holding that this phenomenon occurred before hte beginnings
$ 	of palatalization  (s296)
$ Further note : s262b -- Pope notes that sometimes the older forms were restored by preservative analogy via "clerkly influence"
