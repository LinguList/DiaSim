# DiaSim

This package, or rather earlier stages of it, are covered broadly in Marr & Mortensen 2020 (preprint:https://www.academia.edu/71888418/Computerized_Forward_Reconstruction_for_Analysis_in_Diachronic_Phonology_and_Latin_to_French_Reflex_Prediction) , and Marr & Mortensen 2022 (preprint: https://www.academia.edu/94911785/Large_scale_computerized_forward_reconstruction_yields_new_perspectives_in_French_diachronic_phonology) 

For a run with default configurations, in command line call: bash std_derive.sh

To specify run name, ruleset, and lexicon file: bash derive.sh <RUN_NAME> <RULESET> <LEXFILE>

You may also edit derive.sh and std_derive.sh to designate targets of your choosing.

This file will be expanded with a directory for various guides on usage in 2023.
