Variables that must be reset: [reset()]

Functionality of method reset() -- for debugging purposes. 

reset() versus rebase() -- rebase gets new baseline info
	whereas reset() only changes data structures pertaining (only)
		to the alternate hypothesis.

rebase() will call reset() however -- so reset is essentially a subset of
	rebase in terms of what variables it resets. 

usurpBase() -- functionally a specified case of rebase()
	in which the former alternate hypothesis becomes the new baseline.
