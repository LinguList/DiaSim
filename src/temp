solution:

List<int[]> relocdations
List<int> modifications

-- this seems to be the only way to handle this issue.

Current error in rule correspondences: 

Rule correspondences:
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,-1,7,8,9
0,6,1,2,3,4,1,5,6,7,8

second row should be 
0,6,1,2,3,4,5,-1,7,8,9

> variable : DHS.ruleCorrespondences
DHS.computeRuleCorrespondences 

	call : DifferentialHypothesisSimulator: [constructor]
		computeRuleCorrespondences(baseToHypIndMap)
		
call is from:
DHSW.generateDHS() [SimulationTester:574]

RIM > baseToHypIndMap
RULE_IND_MAP Has been confirmed. 

corrRIM = {0,6,2,3,4,5,1,-1,7,8,9,10}

so, then computeRuleCorrespondences(corrRIM):


--

total_length = 11
prChLocs = new boolean[11]; 
etc

while TRUE
	chLoc = 1
	while TRUE
		rC[0][0] = 0
		bci = 1 
		etc
	while FALSE
	prChLocs[1] = false
	
	chi = 6
	relocdation = true
