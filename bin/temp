issue : changedDerivations is empty but changedRuleEffects is not
and we KNOW there are words that were ultimately changed (fountain, mountain..." )
	in the case of fountain we have confirmed its accurate differentialDerivation....
	
additionally @line 776-9 : no etyma effected
	likely a cascading error from the one with derivations
	
changedRuleEffects -- expected only 7, but found 6,7,8 as well. 	
	
	
how can we have changedRuleEffects but not changedDerivations????

Set<Integer> keys = changedDerivations.keySet();
int N = keys.size() ; 
int[] out = new int[N
