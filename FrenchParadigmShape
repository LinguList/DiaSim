MORPHLEX: $ format : CLASS {SYNTACTIC (SUB)CLASSES, DEFAULT LISTED FIRST}
	NOMINAL {NOUN, ADJ} 
	VERB
		$ note how although adjectives (participles) and infinitives are part of verbal paradigm,
		$... they are not listed as syntactic (sub)classes
		$ because infinitives do not have their own paradigms
		$ while the adjectival paradigm is a nominal paradigm
		$ conversely, ADJ and NOUN are listed as subclasses of NOMINAL
		$ to encode that items of a different morpholexical paradigm (verbs in this case)
		$ that are specified for POS as NOUN or ADJ 
		$ should have the features of a NOMINAL to specify
		
MORPHSYN: $This file uses some Old French distinctions lost in modern French: the neuter, nominal case etc.
