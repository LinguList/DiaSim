	$ to > x > j 
	$ This was clearly from Gaulish influence as this was an allophonic rule in Gaulish.
$Latin final r metathesis : -er, -or > -ro  -- but this one might not actually be critical, because she deals 
	$ mainly with the accusative case for nouns and it didn't seem to occur in monosyllables like per 
	$ In fact she might be right. 
	
$Pope is unclear about the order between palatalization of velar stops before i,e, and intervocalic lenition of g. 
$ This is critical because some of her examples, like regina, that she states for having been palatalized still as stops
$ would have not been stops if the intervocalic lenition had occurred first -- see s333, 
$ s307ii -- here Pope explicitly says gj became palatalized first then fricated -- but this assumes palatalization occurs before lenition
$ whereas she doesn't make this explicit and what she DOES say would seem to go against it, noting that g-frication must have preceded
$ intervocalic gamma deletion processes that are attested for the fourth century (s341), while g-palatalization came after t-palatlization which
$ she says began in the fourht century (s304)

$Ordering ambiguity : Pope dates the lenition of b > beta to the second century (s336) and says the Appendix Probi, from the third or fourth
$ ... century, attests the deletion of unstressed vowels in "proparoxytons" (s261-262)-- this would have this limited apocope happening after b-lenition
$ -- however if this occurred the development of words like table would be very different --- although it might agree with dialectal forms like
$ ... taule instead of table. Pope does not explicitly state however that this apocope came after lenition-- which would obviously be wrong
$ based on the ordering of derivations she presents elsewhere, we can assume she consistently places proparoxytone vowel deletion before lenition

$ s359 -- Pope dates beta > w before consonants "after the fall of unstressed vowels" in words like parabola and parabolare to Late Latin
$ However she explicitly states elsehwere that the fall of unstressed vowels happened later, in the Gallo-Roman stage
$ and the -ola ending is not one of hte proparoxytones that she listed as being effected by effacements in Late Latin 

$ frigidum contradiction : s262ii she explicitly states that -idum words like frigidum lost their penultimate vowel in Late Latin
$ (dated before the onset of palatalization for other words like placitum -- s296i) 
$ so it would become frigidum 
$ she doesn't account for the palatalization of g before d anywhere. 
$ while she does have the g in frigida as palatalized, even though by her own logic -ida should have lost its penultimate faster than -idum 
$ (as per s262ii)
$ it seems her ordering is right but she is missing something : note Appendix Probi "fridigus non fricdus"

$s187 -- Pope says that before w develarized in Late Latin (dated to 1st / 2nd centuries),
$ ... it was "vocalized" to u where it had become prae-consonantal by slurring of an atonic vowel.
$ ... she includes in her examples avicellum. However the slurring of the -i- in avicellum is not described anywhere for Late Latin
$ but rather for Gallo-Roman. 

$ Pope sees final -m deletion and n deletion before s rather than nasalization 
$ Breaking with later authors like Allen 1978, Renato-Oniga, and Clarkson .

$ Pope considers Latin v /w/ to have been a fricative -- ɣʷ -- p74-5 s158
	$ specifically as per p56 s109 : "a fricative bi-labial with velar modification" (βᶭ ?)  
	$ she is probably breaking with most authors on this
	$ she uses w to represent ɣʷ for the period
	$ and u̯ to represent the semivocalic glide.
	$ this is explicitly contradicted by most later authors on Latin -- example Renato Oniga 2007 p17 
$ but at the same time she does call /w/ "hard to differentiate from u" -- p53 s100 
$ Likewise /j/ ("i" in hiatus) seems to not be the glide j but the voiced fricative p55 s105c	$ "although hard to differentiate from i" -- p53 s100 	
	
$ Pope considers Latin qu to have represented "ku̯", i.e. a k + w sequence -- s187 
	$ rather than a single sound kʷ as later authors like Allen 1978 do.
	$ contradicts also Renato-Oniga 2007 p16 -- also for ɡʷ .
