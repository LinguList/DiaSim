$Pope is unclear about the order between palatalization of velar stops before i,e, and intervocalic lenition of g. 
$ This is critical because some of her examples, like regina, that she states for having been palatalized still as stops
$ would have not been stops if the intervocalic lenition had occurred first -- see s333, 
$ s307ii -- here Pope explicitly says gj became palatalized first then fricated -- but this assumes palatalization occurs before lenition
$ whereas she doesn't make this explicit and what she DOES say would seem to go against it, noting that g-frication must have preceded
$ intervocalic gamma deletion processes that are attested for the fourth century (s341), while g-palatalization came after t-palatlization which
$ she says began in the fourht century (s304)

$Ordering ambiguity : Pope dates the lenition of b > beta to the second century (s336) and says the Appendix Probi, from the third or fourth
$ ... century, attests the deletion of unstressed vowels in "proparoxytons" (s261-262)-- this would have this limited apocope happening after b-lenition
$ -- however if this occurred the development of words like table would be very different --- although it might agree with dialectal forms like
$ ... taule instead of table. Pope does not explicitly state however that this apocope came after lenition-- which would obviously be wrong
$ based on the ordering of derivations she presents elsewhere, we can assume she consistently places proparoxytone vowel deletion before lenition

$ s359 -- Pope dates beta > w before consonants "after the fall of unstressed vowels" in words like parabola and parabolare to Late Latin
$ However she explicitly states elsehwere that the fall of unstressed vowels happened later, in the Gallo-Roman stage
$ and the -ola ending is not one of hte proparoxytones that she listed as being effected by effacements in Late Latin 

$ frigidum contradiction : s262ii she explicitly states that -idum words like frigidum lost their penultimate vowel in Late Latin
$ (dated before the onset of palatalization for other words like placitum -- s296i) 
$ so it would become frigidum 
$ she doesn't account for the palatalization of g before d anywhere. 
$ while she does have the g in frigida as palatalized, even though by her own logic -ida should have lost its penultimate faster than -idum 
$ (as per s262ii)
$ it seems her ordering is right but she is missing something : note Appendix Probi "fridigus non fricdus"

$s187 -- Pope says that before w develarized in Late Latin (dated to 1st / 2nd centuries),
$ ... it was "vocalized" to u where it had become prae-consonantal by slurring of an atonic vowel.
$ ... she includes in her examples avicellum. However the slurring of the -i- in avicellum is not described anywhere for Late Latin
$ but rather for Gallo-Roman. 

$ Pope sees final -m deletion and n deletion before s rather than nasalization 
$ Breaking with later authors like Allen 1978, Renato-Oniga, and Clarkson .

$ Pope considers Latin v /w/ to have been a fricative -- ɣʷ -- p74-5 s158
	$ specifically as per p56 s109 : "a fricative bi-labial with velar modification" (βᶭ ?)  
	$ she is probably breaking with most authors on this
	$ she uses w to represent ɣʷ for the period
	$ and u̯ to represent the semivocalic glide.
	$ this is explicitly contradicted by most later authors on Latin -- example Renato Oniga 2007 p17 
$ but at the same time she does call /w/ "hard to differentiate from u" -- p53 s100 
$ Likewise /j/ ("i" in hiatus) seems to not be the glide j but the voiced fricative p55 s105c	$ "although hard to differentiate from i" -- p53 s100 	
	
$ Pope considers Latin qu to have represented "ku̯", i.e. a k + w sequence -- s187 
	$ rather than a single sound kʷ as later authors like Allen 1978 do.
	$ contradicts also Renato-Oniga 2007 p16 -- also for ɡʷ . 

$ Pope considers the kst > st shift to have come after proparoxytone deletion. 
$ However this would cause an incorrect trajectory for buxita > boite.
$ She does not consider this to be an inherited word, but other authors like Rey do. 
$ THe later could be moved before hte former without causing error, on the other hand 

$ Pope does not account for the apparent flapping and lateralization development except for in loanwords
$ It seems to me what happened was n > ɾ̃ > ɾ / [+syl,-prim] __ ə , and the tap then became l (>w) before consonants and r elsewhere
$ This can be seen in animalia > aumaille (which she considers a loan, but Rey does not) 
$ also minimum >> merme -- although Pope holds this to also be an "early loan"
$ This could also explain many French placenames, nothing that in the native Gaulish names for the places,

$	*Anev`ernia > Arvernia > Auvergne, *`Andecanes > Angers (as opposed to <Andecavis as per Pope, which doesn't explain the r)
$	Pictones (> *Pictanes?) > Pejta:rs > Poitiers (with Latin stress; unlike <Pictavis as per Pope oppos) -- a possible o>a can also be seen in "Poitevin"

which does not palatalize

Pope has an ordering issue with regards to these two shifts
	1) o,ɔ > u / __ [+nas]
	2) u > y 
Both affected all vowels of the target quality regardless of stress or length 
The first should not feed the second
However she clearly has the first before the second
The first being in Middle Gallo-Roman, while the second she doesn't assign a start date to 
	But she has it resolving in Early Old French
There are three possible solutions to this: 
	1) when o,ɔ > u, it is a different one, namely a nasalized one, ũ, which would not be affected by the fronting (though it would complicate the target specification of the rule)
	2) u > y starts much earlier -- however it cannot come before or concurrently to the 2nd palatalization (7th century)
	3) u went to an intermediate stage between u and y much earlier than EOF -- likely candidate is ʉ given that all stressed and lengths are affected
This would be appropriate for "Gaulish u" as Pope attributes it, and also commentary by Posner. 
Notably Pope does attribute o>y when followed by tonic i to Early Gallo-Roman -- so y was already in the sound inventory (though perhaps it would be more
	appropriate to have ʉ at taht stage?) 
Note that Pope's graph at s167 DOES show the shift of u>y STARTING in Early Gallo-Roman ("6th-7th centuries")
 	However in s42 she states that Norse loanwords into Norman suggest that the u>y was still productive in the TENTH century! 
s9 -- u>y was "a very slow process" -- she does attribute it to Gaulish -- note that a slow process of u>ʉ>y also happened in Breton, Welsh and Cornish (... and, well, Albanian)
