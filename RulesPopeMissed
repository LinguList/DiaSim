$Pope is unclear about the order between palatalization of velar stops before i,e, and intervocalic lenition of g. 
$ This is critical because some of her examples, like regina, that she states for having been palatalized still as stops
$ would have not been stops if the intervocalic lenition had occurred first -- see s333, 
$ s307ii -- here Pope explicitly says gj became palatalized first then fricated -- but this assumes palatalization occurs before lenition
$ whereas she doesn't make this explicit and what she DOES say would seem to go against it, noting that g-frication must have preceded
$ intervocalic gamma deletion processes that are attested for the fourth century (s341), while g-palatalization came after t-palatlization which
$ she says began in the fourht century (s304)

$Ordering ambiguity : Pope dates the lenition of b > beta to the second century (s336) and says the Appendix Probi, from the third or fourth
$ ... century, attests the deletion of unstressed vowels in "proparoxytons" (s261-262)-- this would have this limited apocope happening after b-lenition
$ -- however if this occurred the development of words like table would be very different --- although it might agree with dialectal forms like
$ ... taule instead of table. Pope does not explicitly state however that this apocope came after lenition-- which would obviously be wrong

$ s359 -- Pope dates beta > w before consonants "after the fall of unstressed vowels" in words like parabola and parabolare ot Late Latin
$ However she explicitly states elsehwere that the fall of unstressed vowels happened later, in the Gallo-Roman stage

$ frigidus/frigida contradiction : in s297 and s316 Pope states vowel effacement in frigidus and frigida comes after palaltalization of the g,
$ ... whereas in s296i and s262ii she explicitly states the opposite
