... , h `ɑ w n̪ i t̪ ɑ m , h `u n̪ t̪ ə , h `ũ n̪ t̪ ə , h `ũː t̪ ə , ɔ̃ t̪ $onte. Frankish. Loaned late into early French, after lenition and h-loss were no longer active. From Pope s673. Still no native word found to replace this : relevant sections include 426, 459-462, 505, though none of them a similar alternative of au+N+(V)+C-oral. In the current large dataset, there is no source word with this pattern.
... , ... , h 'u n̪ t̪ `o w s , h 'ũ n̪ t̪ `ø s , h 'ũː t̪ `ø s , ɔ̃ t̪ ø $honteux. Coinage on Frankish root that likely didn't exist in any stage of Latin at all. From Pope s674 -- countertonic /aw/ followed by n/m + C --- probably didn't exist in native Latin words. In the current large dataset, there is no source word with this pattern.

$successfully replaced, or already covered: 
k 'o l `u k u l ɑ , k 'ɔ n̪ `o k l ɑ , k 'ə n̪ `u ʎ ə , k 'ə n̪ `u ʎ ə , k 'ə n̪ `u ʎ ə , k ə n̪ u j $quenouille. This form was unattested and apparently inherited only in French. Excluded because the irregular dissimilation l>n shift, which did not pertain to the regular shift it was included by Pope to model, would inordinate problems for optimizing the shifts. Replaced with couille < colea which shows the same phenomenon and has otherwise a very similar phonology. (/kuj/ vs. /kənuj/) s
d̪ r `ɑ p p oː s , d̪ r `ɑ p p o s , d̪ r `a s , d̪ r `a s , d̪ r `aː s , d̪ ʁ a $draps. Frankish or Gaulish. Can be eliminated safely because the pattern in question is already handled by corps, temps, and also por(c), etc.
l `i ɡ ɑ t̪ , l `e ɡ ɑ t̪ , l `e j ə θ , l w `ɛ ə , ... , ... $loie. Verb conjugation. fell out of usage. Replaced by raie < rigam, the closest match. Other options included lie < li:gam, and possibly royal, royaux < re:ga:lem, re:ga:le:s, if we assume the stress or lack thereof has no relevance.
b `ɑ l n̪ e oː s , b `ɑ n̪ ʝ o s , b `ã j̃ n̪ t͡s , b `ɛ̃ j̃ n̪ t͡s , b `ɛ̃ s , b ɛ̃ $bains.  Form unattested in Latin. Can be removed safely because the same pattern is already handled by engins < ingenios
