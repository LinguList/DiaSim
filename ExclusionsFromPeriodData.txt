Excluded because the irregular dissimilation l>n shift, which did not pertain to the regular shift it was included by Pope to model, would inordinate problems for optimizing the shifts. Replaced with couille < colea which shows the same phenomenon and has otherwise a very similar phonology. (/kuj/ vs. /kənuj/) s

Analogy may have occurred to replace regular /ɑ/ with /a/ under influence of singular /dra/. Can be eliminated safely because the pattern in question is already handled by corps, temps, and also por(c), etc. The final form with /a/ not /ɑ/ is likely due to analogy from singular /dra/ drap.
